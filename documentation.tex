\section{Introduction}
We would like to offer pubs' clients an application that helps them to choose
the best beer for their evenings. As we know, there are lots of types of
beers, each one different from the other because of a lot of factors,
weel-known by the connoisseurs. In detail we want to permit a smart set of
queries to make an aware choice based on technical parameters, in addition to
data analysis.
